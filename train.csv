2375,0.8124746633709999,0.300046805476,0,f1f277e5d_1/utterance_8.mp4,why because what is acting it's people being people so we think OK well I'm a person so I can act I can be a person

2391,0.5241041258320001,0.358552650966,4,f1f277e5d_4/utterance_28.mp4,and then making it look very natural as if it's no big deal just like when you're sitting in the movie theatre eating popcorn and not paying attention it's no big deal you've gotta get back 
2392,0.0181864136473,0.0,3,f1f277e5d_4/utterance_29.mp4,and make it work for whatever the character is doing at the time it could be very very sophisticated like James Bond Rick and Morty
2393,0.688414345194,0.429102088242,3,f1f277e5d_4/utterance_30.mp4,very sophisticated worker bee Kramer serving chicken Kenny Rogers
